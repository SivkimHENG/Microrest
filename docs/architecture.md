# Distributed System Considerations

- Message Queue : Kafka or RadditMQ for async communication.
- Caching: Redish, Valkey or Memcache.
- Rate Limiting & Throttling: At API Gateway.
- Service Reliability: Circuit Breaker (Resilience4J).
- Monitoring & Logging: ELK stack.
- NoSQL: mongodb,Cassandra.
- Container & Orchestration: Docker and Kubernetes for managing multiple service seamlessly.

## Microservice Architecture

1. User Service: Authentication,profile Managment,permission.
2. IoT Device Service: Register Device, telemetry ingestion, firmware updates.
3. AI Service: Model inference, recommandations, anomly detections.
4. BlockChain Service: Smart contract interactions, transaction ledger.
